## Data Description: Online Retail II Dataset

This dataset contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

### Variables
- **InvoiceNo**: Invoice number. Nominal. A 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with the letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.
- **StockCode**: Product (item) code. Nominal. A 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.
- **Description**: Product (item) name. Nominal.
- **Quantity**: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.
- **InvoiceDate**: Invoice date and time. Numeric. The day and time when a transaction was generated.
- **UnitPrice**: Unit price. Numeric. Product price per unit in sterling (Â£).
- **CustomerID**: Customer number. Nominal. A 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.
- **Country**: Country name. Nominal. The name of the country where a customer resides.

## Models Used for CLV

### BG/NBD Model
The Beta-Geometric/Negative Binomial Distribution (BG/NBD) model is used to predict the number of future transactions for a customer based on their purchase history.

### Gamma-Gamma Model
The Gamma-Gamma model is used to estimate the average monetary value of a customer's transactions, assuming the monetary value does not vary with transaction frequency.

These models are implemented using the [lifetimes](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes) Python package.

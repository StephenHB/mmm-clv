# CLV Prototype - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction

### Product Overview
A Python-based prototype for Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) modeling, leveraging BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models, with modular code and web content ingestion.

### Problem Statement
Businesses need to understand and predict the value of their customers over time to optimize marketing, retention, and resource allocation. Traditional CLV modeling can be complex and inaccessible to non-experts. This project aims to provide a modular, extensible, and well-documented prototype for CLV analysis, making advanced models accessible and reproducible.

### Solution Approach
- Use Python for rapid prototyping and data science compatibility
- Implement BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models for frequency and monetary value prediction
- Modularize code for easy extension and integration
- Ingest and parse reference articles from the web to ground the implementation in best practices
- Provide example usage and documentation for onboarding new users

### Target Audience
Data scientists, analysts, and business stakeholders interested in customer analytics and retention modeling.

## Core Features

- Fetch and parse reference articles for CLV modeling from the web
- Modular implementation of BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models
- Support for data ingestion and preprocessing
- Example usage and extensibility for new CLV models
- Documentation and references from industry and academic sources

## Constraints and Limitations

- Prototype is for educational and demonstration purposes; not production-hardened
- Web content parsing may be brittle to changes in source websites
- Model accuracy depends on data quality and assumptions

## User Stories

1. **As a data scientist**, I want to fetch and review reference articles on CLV modeling, so I can understand the theory and best practices behind the implementation.
2. **As a developer**, I want modular code for BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models, so I can easily extend or adapt the models for my own datasets.
3. **As a business analyst**, I want to run example scripts to estimate CLV for a sample customer base, so I can evaluate the potential business impact.
4. **As a product owner**, I want clear documentation and references, so I can onboard new team members and justify technical decisions.
5. **As a data engineer**, I want to preprocess and clean customer transaction data, so the models can be applied reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The system can fetch and display the main content from at least three reference web articles on CLV modeling
- The codebase includes modular Python classes for BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models, with docstrings and example usage
- There is a script or notebook demonstrating data ingestion, preprocessing, model fitting, and prediction
- Documentation explains the modeling approach, references, and how to extend the code
- The system can be run with minimal setup (documented dependencies)

## Timeline

- Project setup, requirements gathering, and reference article ingestion
- Implement modular BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma model classes, and demonstrate usage of the lifetimes package for CLV modeling (including a code example and documentation)
   Develop data ingestion and preprocessing utilities
- Create example scripts/notebooks and documentation
- Testing, review, and extensibility planning

## Extensibility and Future Work

- Add support for additional CLV models (Pareto/NBD, Modified Beta-Geometric, etc.)
- Integrate with real-world datasets and data pipelines
- Build a simple web or dashboard interface for business users
- Add automated tests and CI/CD for reliability
- Explore productionization and scaling for larger datasets

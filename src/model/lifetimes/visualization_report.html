<h1>CLV Analysis Visualization Report</h1>
<h2>Raw Data Analysis</h2>
<p>The following plots show the distribution of transaction quantities and unit prices in the raw dataset. These help identify outliers, data quality issues, and the overall sales distribution.</p>
<h2>RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis</h2>
<p>RFM analysis segments customers based on how recently (Recency), how often (Frequency), and how much (Monetary) they purchase. These distributions help identify high-value and at-risk customers.</p>
<h2>CLV Model Results</h2>
<p>The following plots show the distribution of model-estimated monetary value, frequency, recency, and predicted 30-day CLV. The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between frequency and monetary value, highlighting different customer segments.</p>
<h2>Probability Customer is Alive (BG/NBD Heatmap)</h2>
<p>This heatmap shows the probability that a customer is still "alive" (active) as a function of their purchase frequency and recency, based on the BG/NBD model. Higher frequency and lower recency (recent purchases) correspond to higher probabilities of being active. This visualization helps target retention efforts.</p>
